It's odd how in the Merry Shelley-Godwin version they claim they had a friend.  yet in every other version this isn't the case to be shown it just says school fellows. This makes it seem as if in the the other three versions he wasn't friends with Henry Clerval while in Merry's version it does. which is ironic because the two characters still have a relation due to their fathers being good friends.

In this version of Frankenstein, 1818 edition this first passage is in all versions but the Shelly-Godwin version. What is very interesting is this was added to clear up any missed information. Although in the versions the come after this the ending paragraph is completely different. Which honestly draws some confusion on what it trying to say.

When it comes from moving to each version in the variorum it is very simple and fluid. Although it easy to transition from each edition and section of the stories it's not the best experience. I found it to be nice that each time you switch between version that it started at the top but it got bother some sometimes when trying to compare each version. This was due to constantly losing where I was and taking additional time trying to find where I left off.
