# About Me

Hi my name is Jalen, I prefer to go by Jay. I'm an

artist who has an interest in coding and programming.

I just started learning github and photoshop along with

a few other things. I'm currently a freshman at Penn

State Behrend studying digital humanities. I have

interest in gaming and game development, graphics,

music, and A.I.
