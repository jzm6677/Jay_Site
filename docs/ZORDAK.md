first the game is a pixel game that give you a track at wete your frame rate is at.
The settings can hevily affect the games visual, perfomace, audio and even gameplay controls.
It seem that the charater we played as was a lone sutvior of a space mission whos now stuck on a watsed plant called zodark adn the sound of electricty and water really help give off  that feel.
