For my corpus analysis reflection I chose to analyize and compare Shakespeare, Macbeth and Bram Stoker, Dracula. Both these stories draw on the concept of there charaters desires so I wonder what the similarities the play and the story might have in style between each other.

# Charm of A Vampire
In Dracula I found it suprising to see the word a used as often as it was. It seemed as of the in grams the popped up were words that desribed things. Like in the or a room and so on to desribe things the story came across.

# To Be a King

In Macbeth Iâ€™m not surprise that the most used word is the name Macbeth. The story is written as a play write which means names are going to be brough up often.

# N-Gram comparison
In the AntConc files you can see n-grams in the Macbeth play are describing settings of places and the environment. While in the story Dracula the most common n-grams shown descriptions of what is seen, heard or felt.
