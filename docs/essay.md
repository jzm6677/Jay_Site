# Experience in Developing

As some who is new to GitHub and WordPress it was somewhat challenging.  It seemed that GitHub was easier to produce pages and organize a layout. While WordPress was easy to input information and embed media from other sources. What was hard about WordPress was trying to get around the website and to add almost anything to it. That goes from menus or themes to connecting pages it just felt disorganized. With GitHub the problem was just learning how to use the markdown language after you do that it quite easy. Altogether there isn't any skills you need in order to work these sites you can be a total beginner. Yet if you have an extensive knowledge in html or CSS you could have much more control of how your site would look and work.
